    "Ridge regression is a model tuning method that is used to analyse any data that suffers from multicollinearity. This method performs L2 regularization.\n",

    "Ridge regression is a term used to refer to a linear regression model whose coefficients are estimated not by ordinary least squares (OLS), but by an estimator, called ridge estimator, that, albeit biased, has lower variance than the OLS estimator."

    "Selecting a good value for λ is critical. When λ=0, the penalty term has no effect, and ridge regression will produce the classical least square coefficients. However, as λ increases to infinite, the impact of the shrinkage penalty grows, and the ridge regression coefficients will get close zero"

    "# ANSWER 5\n",
    "Multicollinearity happens when predictor variables exhibit a correlation among themselves. Ridge regression aims at reducing the standard error by adding some bias in the estimates of the regression. The reduction of the standard error in regression estimates significantly increases the reliability of the estimates."
